# RISE notifications for Mozilla Firefox (Android Version)

This is the **Android** version of the Firefox extension.
This is a browser extension for receiving RISE notifications for Mozilla Firefox and Firefox-based browsers (e.g. TOR browser, Waterfox, Pale Moon).
It checks up to 5 RISE addresses simultaneously; You do not have to be the owner of the given addresses, so you can give any address you like. The extension currently supports 7 languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and Russian).

Usage is straightforward: simply give 1 to 5 RISE addresses you want to follow. Notifications about transactions from or to the RISE address will be displayed within 60 seconds.

### Summary
* Receive notifications for up to 5 RISE addresses in 7 different languages
* Near real-time notifications (<60 seconds) for incoming and outgoing transactions for each given RISE address
* Shows basic public information for each address, such as the current amount of RISE and the name of the delegate (if the account holder of the address has voted)
* On startup, shows notifications for any missed transactions when the browser was not running
